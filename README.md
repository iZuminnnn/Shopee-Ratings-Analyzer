# ShopeeRatingsAnalyzer

This project is a JavaScript-based tool for fetching and analyzing product ratings from the Shopee.vn website.

## How it works

The script extracts the shop ID and product ID from the URL of the current page and fetches product ratings from the Shopee API. The fetched data is then analyzed to count the number of each product item in the ratings.

## How to use

1. Open a product page on the Shopee.vn website.
2. Open the browser's developer tools (usually by pressing F12 or right-clicking on the page and selecting "Inspect").
3. Navigate to the "Console" tab in the developer tools.
4. Copy and paste the entire code into the console and press Enter.

## Disclaimer

This code may not work if the Shopee.vn website or its API has changed since the code was written. Also, be aware that running scripts from unknown sources in your browser's console can be risky as it can potentially expose sensitive data. Always make sure you understand what a script does before running it.
